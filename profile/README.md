</p>

##  🚀 Getting Started

Looking to get started with building UTxO‑based protocols and transaction workflows on Cardano using **tx3**? You’ve come to the right place.  
**tx3** is a purely functional, domain‑specific language (DSL) designed specifically for describing transaction templates and protocol interfaces in UTxO‑based blockchains.

Learn the tx3 language and tooling with the [official documentation](https://docs.txpipe.io/tx3), which covers everything from concepts and examples to integration with Rust, NodeJS, Python and Go.
Explore the tx3 ecosystem and source code via the official repository: [tx3‑lang/tx3](https://github.com/tx3‑lang/tx3).

Join us at [Rare Evo](https://rareevo.io) and connect with the tx3 team and fellow developers working on UTxO-based protocols!

📋 **[Rare Evo Dev Days – Hands-On Guide](https://gist.github.com/scarmuega/705f673d83e937d8e14206fa06d6a9f0)**

This guide includes everything you need to follow along during our hands-on sessions:

- ✅ Installing tx3 and setting up the CLI with `tx3up` and VS Code
- ⚙️ A guided walkthrough of a basic protocol, leveraging the full tx3 toolchain with `trix`
- 🧪 Exploring an advanced example with a token vending machine (including valid and failing flows)
- 🌐 Integrating with a frontend app using `trix bindgen`, React, and TypeScript

Whether you're brand new to tx3 or already exploring UTxO-based protocol design, this session will help you level up your transaction engineering skills.
